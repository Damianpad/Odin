    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <p>This section follows <a href="https://javascript.info/types">This article</a></p>
    <p>A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number</p>
    <p>There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. We can put any type in a variable.</p>
    <code>
        let message = "hello";
        message = 12345;
    </code>

    <p>Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript are called "Dynamically Typed", meaning that 
        there exists data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.
    </p>

    <h1>Number</h1>
    <code>
        let n = 123;
        n = 12.345;
    </code>
    <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers
        There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>Infinity represents the mathematical infinity. It it a special value that's greater than any number.
    </p>
    <code>
        alert(Infinity); // Infinity
    </code>
    <p>
        NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance, 
    </p>
    <code>
        alert("not a number" / 2); // NaN
    </code>
