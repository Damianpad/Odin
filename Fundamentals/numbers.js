Arithmetic Operations
*********************
A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers

*/

//The two numbers can be literals
let x = 100 + 50;

// or Variables
let a;

// or expressions

let z = (100 + 50) * a;

Operators and Operands
*********************
The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called *operands*
The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator

Operand                 Operator                    Operand
100                     +                           50
